# Advent of Code 2024

I'm doing the AOC2024 for fun in Rust. I may do one or 2 days only, for sure it won't be completed. I'm also busy and I'm just coding those as fast as I could.

The puzzle input should be saved as "input.txt" in the `src/dayX` folder.

To run a particular day, launch `time cargo run --bin dayX`.

Days can be tested with `cargo test`
